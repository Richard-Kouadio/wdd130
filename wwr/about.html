      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Whitewater Rafting has been guiding river adventures for over 20 years. Our passion for the
        outdoors and commitment to safety have helped us create lifelong memories for thousands of
        guests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Founded by a group of avid rafters and nature enthusiasts, our company began as a small
        local
        business with a vision to share the thrill of the rapids with others. Over the years, we
        have
        expanded to offer trips across some of the most scenic and challenging rivers in the
        country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout our journey, safety and environmental stewardship have been our top priorities.
        We
        work closely with local communities to preserve the natural beauty and promote responsible
        adventure tourism. Our experienced guides are passionate about sharing their knowledge and
        ensuring every trip is both exciting and safe.
